Professors DM and CC provided various forms of resources. xxxx. Thanks to modern LLM tools, the five-year project (the pre-LLM era) was completed in just one year, of course, [the road ahead](https://world-snapshot.github.io/doc/index.html?page=S6_materials/04_questions.md#future-work-full-roadmap) is still very long.
