## Contributions

**How to contribute to this project:** Overall, It is like Minecraft or Terraria - it is forward-compatible/game-mod-style. We strive to make it easy for everyone to contribute, even without submitting a PR. Of course, we also fully welcome submissions. Each repository has a Contributing.md file that automatically displays on the code page of the repository, providing more details and the RoadMap of the repository.

**Initial team:** Sen Fang provided the majority of the ideas, wrote most of the documents, and designed the framework for multiple models/warehouses. Professors DM and CC provided various forms of resources. xxxx. Thanks to Claude Code and other LLM tools, the five-year project (the pre-LLM era) was completed in just one year, of course, [the road ahead](https://world-snapshot.github.io/doc/index.html?page=S6_materials/04_questions.md#future-work-full-roadmap) is still very long.

**Related work:** Apart from expressing our deep gratitude to [previous various resources](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/wsg), there are some aspects of previous work that are truly worth learning and paying attention to, as they form the foundation of our work.
