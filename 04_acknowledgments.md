## Acknowledgments

We thank all our colleagues and collaborators for their valuable feedback and discussions. This work was supported in part by NSF grants, and we gratefully acknowledge the [open-source code and various resources](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/wsg) used for this project. Special thanks to the research community for their constructive feedback during the development of this work.

**Additional Declaration & To the Media:** Our work is an exploration aimed at an ideal world model, following the principles of "conformal symmetry + encoding all information to the boundary", using our defined Wave Generative Models (or Wave-based Model) as the primary structure.

- All work that conforms to our definition, approximation, or derivative with the goal of exploring ideal world models will be called World Snapshot Model series/family. Just as deep learning evolved from machine learning yet is different. We are intentionally establishing an independent research field/area distinct from all existing claimed world models (video generation, hybrid Agents, VLMs, robotics, and new image generation architectures, etc). So we will be the "World Snapshot Model" research area. *Interactive physical image and scene reconstruction, are our prototype work, although they typically only meet [3/9 of our standards](https://world-snapshot.github.io/doc/index.html?page=S5_blogs/00_world_model.md#definition).*
- 2-4D models using our defined wave generation mechanism (such as recording 3D information wave space), with the goal of exploring generative models, will be called or belong to Wave Generative Models (or Wave-based Model).
- The wave mainly refers to the probability wave in space (not a collection of individual particle clouds, but a continuous function composed of multiple functions that can be infinitely differentiated and represents a probability distribution). Creating a probability distribution composed of functions to correspondingly manipulate the richly informative surface of the world (world snapshot) like a shadow is the core concept of the wave generation model.
- The process of generating content not from random pixels/noise, but through meaningful information tensors (shapes, spatial information, planar structures), initializing a start with multi-dimensional information (It is generally more than the original model, for example, using image structures with 3D information to assist ordinary image generation models), is called "Sen Fang Initialization", which can be applied to a broader range of AI models. Just as an internal combustion engine needs an igniter, "Sen Fang Initialization" generally uses lighter techniques to generate a meaningful initial input.
- The Wave Generation Method (WaveGen) and the World Snapshot Models (WSMs) address distinct, orthogonal dimensions of the problem, yet they remain fundamentally intertwined—much like the double helix of DNA. It is precisely because they handle different aspects of the system that these two approaches are inherently interdependent. They should be viewed as components of a naturally unified architecture.

**Limitations:** Due to the limitation of computing resources as non-industrial team, the project is still at an [initial stage](https://world-snapshot.github.io/doc/index.html?page=S6_materials/04_questions.md#future-work-full-roadmap) and has not fully achieved its optimal performance. This project (including multiple warehouses, concepts, code, and models) will continue to be updated and developed. The subsequent results will also be completely open-source or released in the form of articles.

**Q&As:** More information will be continuously updated to [this link](https://world-snapshot.github.io/doc/index.html?page=S6_materials/04_questions.md). If does not exist, please submit an issue.

**Announcement:** The selected News will be updated on the Github organization [introduction page](https://github.com/World-Snapshot) of the project, and the complete news will be updated on the [corresponding page](https://world-snapshot.github.io/doc/index.html?page=S6_materials/01_news.md) of the document.
