## Experiment

The hundreds of kinds results/evalution/plugins can be found at [World-Snapshot/The-results-of-Augustus](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/The-results-of-Augustus). The number of supported tasks is constantly updated (there could be potentially over 1000 types in the future). Please click to view.

In the future, the results may be stored in a new position. The plugins will be updated within [ControlWave](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/ControlWave). The qualitative assessment is in the [Demo Section](#demos).
