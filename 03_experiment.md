## Experiment

The hundreds of kinds results/evalution/plugins can be found at [World-Snapshot/The-results-of-Augustus](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/The-results-of-Augustus). The number of supported tasks is constantly updated (there could be potentially over 1000 types in the future). Please click to view.

In the future, the results may be stored in a new position. The plugins will be updated within [ControlWave](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/ControlWave). The qualitative assessment is in the [Demo Section](#demos).

[Our approach](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/Unified-Law-for-Visual-Tasks) requires almost no modification to the structure of the existing generation model (you can also make adjustments to speed up training), and enables the existing generation model to achieve the [same level](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/The-results-of-Augustus) of capabilities as ours (generation, understanding, estimation, segmentation, detection, reconstruction, etc). Moreover, it is highly scalable, with single researcher being able to increase the model's capabilities by 10-50 types each month until reaching the upper limit of computer vision (of course, this upper limit can also be expanded, and a conservative estimate of the number of expansions is [difficult to count](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/The-results-of-Augustus?tab=readme-ov-file#future-task-list)).
