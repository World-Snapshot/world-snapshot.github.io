Project page of the World Snapshot, I developed a super clean and lightweight website template just for it.

This is a website template that needs to be rendered by the server, so if you want to modify and view it in real time, you can't do it like html, but use one of vscode's plug-ins: Live Server (by Ritwick Dey). Similar local server plug-in should also work.

CC BY-SA 4.0: Feel free to use this template, but please keep the Powered by [World Snapshot](https://github.com/World-Snapshot/world-snapshot.github.io).
